# Terms and Conditions


By downloading or using **Coffee Mania** app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Kyryl Horbushko.

In order to access our Services, whether or not you are an existing or former user, you confirm that you have read these Terms of Use (“Terms”). Whenever you use our Services, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to these Terms, and you also agree to our Privacy and Cookie Policies. We may make changes to our Terms from time to time. We will publish all changes on this page with the date these amendments are made located at the top of the page, so that you know when we last updated the Terms. This also applies to our Privacy and Cookie Policies. Your continued use of our Services after any amendments constitutes your acceptance of any such amendments. If you do not agree to comply with these Terms, please do not register to use, access or continue to use our Services.

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that are added to the current Services, including the release of new tools and resources, shall be subject to these Terms.
 
We may update or require you to update the Services to implement technical adjustments or make improvements, provided that the Services shall always match the description provided in all material respects.
 
By using our Services, you confirm that (i) you are at least 13 years old; and (ii) your use of the Services will not violate any applicable law or regulation in the province state, territory or country in which you reside.

Kyryl Horbushko is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.

The **Coffee Mania** app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide my Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the CoffeeMania app won’t work properly or at all.

You should be aware that there are certain things that Kyryl Horbushko will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Kyryl Horbushko cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.

If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.

Along the same lines, Kyryl Horbushko cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Kyryl Horbushko cannot accept responsibility

With respect to Kyryl Horbushko’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Kyryl Horbushko accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.

At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on iOS – the requirements for this system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Kyryl Horbushko does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the iOS/Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
